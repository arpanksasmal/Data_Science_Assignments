    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Initialization: The code begins by defining a ListNode class for constructing the linked list. The swapPairs function is then introduced, starting with the creation of a dummy node. This dummy node simplifies edge cases, such as handling the head of the list during swaps.\n",

    "The loop continues as long as there are at least two more nodes to process (prev.next and prev.next.next).\n",

    "The prev pointer is moved to first (which is now positioned after second) to prepare for the next pair swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Completion: Once the while loop is finished (meaning there are fewer than two nodes left to swap), the function returns dummy.next. This pointer now refers to the new head of the modified list after all swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Printing Functionality:\n",
    "The printList function iterates over the linked list and prints each value. It uses a conditional to format the output, appending an arrow (->) if there is a subsequent node, thereby enhancing readability.\n",

    "This Python code defines a function to flatten a multilevel doubly linked list into a single-level doubly linked list. A multilevel doubly linked list is a complex data structure where each node might contain links to other nodes via 'next' and 'child' pointers, where 'next' connects to the next node in the same level, and 'child' connects to the head of a lower level list. The code uses a stack-based approach to iteratively process each node, connecting all nodes linearly according to a depth-first traversal order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the explanation of this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Node Class Definition: A class named Node is defined to create node objects for the doubly linked list. Each node object can store values and pointers to previous nodes (prev), next nodes (next), and child nodes (child), which point to the head of a subsidiary list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Flattening Function: The function flatten takes the head of the multilevel doubly linked list as input and returns the head of a new, flattened list. The function utilizes a temporary node (pseudo_head) to simplify handling of the head node, particularly to manage any modifications at the start of the list smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Depth-First Traversal Using Stack: The function employs a stack to manage the depth-first traversal of the list. Starting with the head of the list, nodes are popped from the stack one at a time. For each node processed, if it has a next node, that node is pushed onto the stack and disconnected from the current node to avoid cycles. Similarly, if the node has a child, the child is also pushed onto the stack and then disconnected.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Re-linking Nodes: As nodes are processed, they are re-linked in a flat sequence. Each node popped from the stack is linked to the previous node processed (prev). This effectively flattens the child structures into a single sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Final Adjustments: After all nodes are processed, the initial pseudo node’s next pointer's previous link is cleared to ensure there are no residual back-references to the pseudo node. The new head of the flattened list is then returned (which is pseudo_head.next).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Construction and Output of List: A list of nodes is manually created and linked based on the specified child and next connections. After constructing the full multilevel structure, the flatten function is called with the head of the list, and the resulting flattened list is printed in sequence."

    "This Python code adds one to a non-negative number represented as a linked list. It treats the linked list as a reversed number, performs the addition, and then reverses the result back into a linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the explanation of this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Initialization:\n",
    "The code begins by defining a ListNode class to create nodes for the linked list.\n",
    "The addOne function is introduced, taking head (the head of the linked list) as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Reversing the Linked List:\n",
    "The linked list is first reversed to make it easier to perform addition from the least significant digit (rightmost digit).\n",
    "This is achieved by iterating through the list while reversing the pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Performing Addition:\n",
    "The reversed linked list is traversed again to add one to the number.\n",
    "A carry variable is initialized to 1, representing the value to be added.\n",
    "At each node, the current value is incremented by the carry, and the carry is updated accordingly.\n",
    "If the carry becomes 0 or the end of the list is reached, the addition process terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Reversing the Result:\n",
    "After the addition is performed, the result (now represented as a reversed number) is reversed back into a linked list.\n",
    "This step is similar to the initial reversal, iterating through the list while reversing the pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Returning the Result:\n",
    "The function returns the head of the linked list containing the result of adding one to the original number.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Printing the Linked List:\n",
    "The printList function prints the values of the linked list nodes.\n",
    "It iterates through the list and prints each node's value, appending an arrow (->) if there is a subsequent node.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Execution and Output:\n",
    "The code constructs an example linked list representing the number 123.\n",
    "It prints the original list, adds one to the number using the addOne function, and prints the resulting list."

    "1.Initialization: The function findKthLargest takes two parameters: nums, an array of integers, and k, the position of the largest element desired when the array is considered in sorted order.

    "This Python code defines a function named power to calculate the power of a given base raised to a given exponent using recursion. The function utilizes a recursive approach to compute the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down how the code operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Function Definition:\n",
    "The power function takes two parameters: base, representing the base number, and exponent, representing the exponent to which the base is raised.\n",
    "It aims to return the result of raising base to the power of exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Base Cases:\n",
    "The function includes two base cases to handle the termination condition of the recursion:\n",
    "If the exponent is 0, it returns 1, as any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1.\n",
    "If the exponent is 1, it returns the base itself, as any number raised to the power of 1 equals the number itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Recursive Calculation:\n",
    "If the exponent is neither 0 nor 1, the function recursively calculates the result by multiplying the base with the result of raising the base to the power of exponent - 1.\n",
    "This recursive call effectively reduces the exponent by 1 in each iteration until it reaches one of the base cases (exponent equals 0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Return the Result:\n",
    "The final result of raising base to the power of exponent is returned after the recursive calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Execution and Output:\n",
    "An example input base = 3 and exponent = 4 is provided to demonstrate the function.\n",
    "When power(base, exponent) is called with base = 3 and exponent = 4, the function computes and returns 81, as 3^4 equals 3 * 3 * 3 * 3, which is 81.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Example Explanation:\n",
    "The function recursively computes the result by multiplying the base (3) with the result of raising the base to the power of exponent - 1 (i.e., power(3, 3)).\n",
    "This process continues until the exponent reaches one of the base cases (0 or 1), at which point the recursion terminates, and the final result is returned."
