    "Let's break down the code step by step:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Recurrence Relation Function Definition**:\r\n",
    "   The code defines a function named \"recurrence_relation\" that takes an integer argument \"n\". This function represents the given recurrence relation T(n) = 3T(n-1) + 12n.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Base Case (n = 0)**:\r\n",
    "   Inside the function, there's an if-else statement. The base case is when \"n\" is equal to 0. In this case, the function returns a predefined value of 5. This is the initial condition provided in the problem statement: T(0) = 5.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Recursive Case**:\r\n",
    "   For any value of \"n\" other than 0, the function follows the recurrence relation: T(n) = 3T(n-1) + 12n. It recursively calls itself with the argument \"n-1\" and performs the necessary calculations to determine the value of T(n).\r\n",

    "This problem involves solving the recurrence relation T(n) = T(n/2) + c using the substitution method. Here's how we approach it:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Assumed Solution Form**:\r\n",
    "   We assume a solution form for T(n) as \"an + b\", where 'a' and 'b' are constants to be determined.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Substitution into Recurrence Relation**:\r\n",
    "   We substitute this assumed form into the given recurrence relation T(n) = T(n/2) + c.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Expanding and Simplifying**:\r\n",
    "   After substitution, we simplify the equation to \"an + b = a(n/2) + b + c\".\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Rearranging Terms**:\r\n",
    "   Rearranging terms, we simplify the equation to \"(a/2)n = c\". This implies that 'a' must be equal to 2c/n for the equation to hold.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Determining Constants**:\r\n",
    "   Substituting a = 2c/n back into our assumed form of the solution, we get \"T(n) = (2c/n)n + b = 2c + b\".\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. **Verification by Induction**:\r\n",
    "   - **Base Case**: For n = 1, T(1) = 2c + b.\r\n",
    "   - **Inductive Step**: Assume that T(k) = 2c + b holds for some arbitrary k ≥ 1. Now, let's prove that T(2k) = 2c + b holds.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "7. **Conclusion**:\r\n",
    "   By verifying the base case and the inductive step, we conclude that the assumed solution T(n) = 2c + b satisfies the recurrence relation T(n) = T(n/2) + c for all n ≥ 1.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Therefore, the solution to the recurrence relation T(n) = T(n/2) + c using the substitution method is T(n) = 2c + b, where 'b' is an arbitrary constant and 'c' is the given constant in the recurrence relation.\r\n"
