    "This Python code provides a basic implementation of a ToDo list, allowing the addition of tasks, marking tasks as completed, and displaying pending tasks. The example usage demonstrates the application of this system with a specific instance of a ToDo list and associated tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Task Class Definition: The Task class is defined with an __init__ method to initialize task attributes such as description, due date, and completion status.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.ToDoList Class Definition: The ToDoList class is defined with an __init__ method to initialize an empty list of tasks. It includes methods add_task to add tasks to the list, mark_task_completed to update the completion status of a task, and display_pending_tasks to print pending tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.ToDoList Instance Creation: An instance of the ToDoList class (todo_list) is created to manage and interact with tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Adding Tasks to ToDoList: Tasks are added to the todo_list using the add_task method. Specific tasks are added, such as \"Complete project,\" \"Prepare for meeting\" (with a due date), and \"Exercise.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Displaying Pending Tasks (Before Completion): The display_pending_tasks method is called on the todo_list to print the pending tasks, including their descriptions and, if applicable, due dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Marking a Task as Completed: The mark_task_completed method is called on the todo_list to mark the task \"Prepare for meeting\" as completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Displaying Pending Tasks (After Completion): The display_pending_tasks method is called again on the todo_list to print the updated list of pending tasks, excluding the completed task.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Printed Output: The printed output includes the list of pending tasks before and after marking a task as completed, showing the descriptions and due dates (if available)."
